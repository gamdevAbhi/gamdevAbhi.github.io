#### About:
I’m thrilled to share a recent project I’ve been working on—an isometric procedurally generated 2D biome system in Unity Engine. This tool allows you to create a diverse range of biomes including forests, deserts, snowy regions, seas, islands, rivers, mountains, and so much more, all with a few tweaks to the parameters. Enhanced with noise smoothing techniques to produce more natural and visually appealing results. By adjusting parameters, you can sculpt unique landscapes, each with its own distinct features and characteristics.

#### Features:
- **Diverse Biome**: From lush forests to arid deserts, snowy terrains to serene seas, the system generates various biomes seamlessly.  
- **Noise-Smoothing**: Fine-tune the biome generation with adjustable parameters for endless creative possibilities.  
- **Modified Wave Function Collapse**: My custom WFC implementation, coupled with noise smoothing, ensures that the generated biomes are both varied and coherent.  

**Technology Used**: C#, Unity Game Engine, Photoshop.
